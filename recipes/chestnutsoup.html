    <p>Tyrion may suspect Cersei’s motives, but he does not question his sister’s
        taste in food. Chestnuts seem to be a foil to the Queen."(A Clash of

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). Cut an X into each chestnut on the flat side.</li>
        <li>Place on a baking sheet and bake for 30–35 minutes, turning
            frequently. Peel while still warm. Chop chestnuts coarsely and set
            aside.</li>
        <li>In a soup pot, melt butter or fat over medium-high heat. Add leeks;
            sauté 3 minutes. Add carrot and celery; continue to sauté 2 minutes
            longer.</li>
        <li>Add chestnuts and thyme, and cook for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add broth to pot; bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to medium;
            simmer 30 minutes or until chestnuts are very tender. Remove from
            heat and let cool briefly.</li>
        <li>Blend in batches to purée soup. Strain through a fine sieve into a fresh
            pot. Reheat soup, then season with parsley, salt, and pepper.</li>
